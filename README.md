# Flexile

Contractor payments as easy as 1-2-3.

## Setup

You'll need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (see [`.node-version`](.node-version))
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

The easiest way to set up the development environment is to use the [`bin/setup` script](bin/setup), but feel free to run the commands in it yourself:

### Backend

- Set up Ruby (ideally using `rbenv`/`rvm`) and PostgreSQL
- Navigate to backend code and install dependencies: `cd backend && bundle i && gem install foreman`

### Frontend

- Navigate to frontend app and install dependencies `cd frontend && pnpm i`

Finally, set up your environment: `cp .env.example .env`. If you're an Antiwork team member, you can use `vercel env pull .env`.

## Running the App

You can start the local app using the [`bin/dev` script](bin/dev) - or feel free to run the commands contained in it yourself.

Once the local services are up and running, the application will be available at `https://flexile.dev`

**Development shortcuts**:

- If `ENABLE_DEFAULT_OTP=true` is set in your `.env`, you can use `000000` as the OTP for logging in or signing up.
- Use these pre-seeded accounts (password: `password` for all):
  - **Admin**: `hi+sahil@example.com` (Primary Administrator)
  - **Contractor**: `hi+sharang@example.com` (Software Engineer)
  - **Investor**: `hi+chris@example.com` (Investor)
  - **More accounts**: See [the seed data](backend/config/data/seed_templates/gumroad.json) for additional test users (emails are always hi+firstname@example.com)

## Common Issues / Debugging

### 1. Postgres User Creation

**Issue:** When running `bin/dev` (after `bin/setup`) encountered `FATAL: role "username" does not exist`

**Resolution:** Manually create the Postgres user with:

```
psql postgres -c "CREATE USER username WITH LOGIN CREATEDB SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';"
```

Likely caused by the `bin/setup` script failing silently due to lack of Postgres superuser permissions (common with Homebrew installations).

### 2. Redis Connection & database seeding

**Issue:** First attempt to run `bin/dev` failed with `Redis::CannotConnectError` on port 6389.

**Resolution:** Re-running `bin/dev` resolved it but data wasn't seeded properly, so had to run `db:reset`

Likely caused by rails attempting to connect before Redis had fully started.

## Testing

```shell
# Run Rails specs
bundle exec rspec # Run all specs
bundle exec rspec spec/system/roles/show_spec.rb:7 # Run a single spec

# Run Playwright end-to-end tests
pnpm playwright test
```
